The learner. The wolrd's most premier spaced repitition app.

I subscribe to the idea that the human brain has a finite amount of will power. 

Why waste your learning energy on thinking about when to revisit a topic or practice your skills? Or finding the relevant notes and picking some practice problems?
This adds up, a lot. By the time I'm all set up to do something, I often am out of energy. Then I get discouraged because I didn't "do" anything "productive".

No longer. My best learning happens when I write notes on paper and do practice problems. I find this to be a difficult system to manage. Multiple notebooks, difficulties balancing digital and paper information, etc. Because of that, I have trouble revisiting the information and I inevidentably lose the skills I grind so hard for because I don't have a system for offloading the management of my learning so I can just LEARN and REINFORCE.

Time efficiency and long term proficiency are the goals of any learning endeaver. These are the primary advantages of a spaced learning based approach. Another advantage is that by spending less time per session than my usual ad hoc approach, the learning process will have a greater variety and specificity, which helps curve boredom.

Most online solutions fit only some of my needs. I decided to make my own so I could solve my own learning difficulties in a way that way intuitive to me. So here it is, plain and simple:

The lrnr allows me to upload my notes and practice problems when I first learn a new skill. Then calendar events are created at intervals of 1 day, 3 days, 10 days, 30 days, and 60 days. Each event has a decreasing amount of time needed for studying over time. I.e. you may study for an hour the first time and only 20 minutes the last time. Each day, I check in and do my learning for the day, taking on something new each day as well. Another benfit is this systems provides natural feedback on how much new information is really feasible to learn each day, which can be extrapolated to weeks, months, etc, and eventually allow for better planning of future endouvers via a more informed estimation process.

That's all for now. Let's learn!
